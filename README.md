- **Structured Outputs**: Ensures consistency in the generated CLOs and skills.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple interface for ease of use.
- **Customizable**: Tailor the outputs based on specific needs.

## Technologies Used

This project incorporates a variety of technologies to achieve its goals:

- **AI**: Core component for generating CLOs.
- **NLP**: Analyzes text data from course descriptions.
- **LLMs**: Utilizes models like GPT-3 for language understanding.
- **Machine Learning**: Fine-tunes the model based on user feedback.
- **Deep Learning**: Enhances the model's ability to understand complex language structures.
- **Transfer Learning**: Adapts pre-trained models for specific tasks.

## Getting Started

To get started with the CLO Generator, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/voulzontwitch/clo-generatorr.git
   ```
   
2. **Install Dependencies**: 
   Navigate to the project directory and install the required packages.
   ```bash
   cd clo-generatorr
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the Model**: 
   You can download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/voulzontwitch/clo-generatorr/releases) section. Execute the necessary files to set up the model.

4. **Run the Application**: 
   Start the application using:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can use it to generate CLOs by following these steps:

1. **Input Course Description**: Enter a brief description of the course you want to analyze.
2. **Generate Outcomes**: Click the "Generate" button to receive a list of suggested CLOs and skills.
3. **Review and Customize**: Review the generated outcomes and customize them as needed.

### Example

- **Input**: "This course introduces students to the principles of programming using Python."
- **Output**:
  - CLO1: Understand basic programming concepts.
  - CLO2: Develop simple Python applications.
  - Skills: Problem-solving, Critical thinking, Programming.
