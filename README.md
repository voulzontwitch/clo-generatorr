Automated CLO and Skill Generator Using NLP
This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs) and relevant skill sets from course descriptions. It aims to simplify and standardize the curriculum design process by generating clear, structured outputs aligned with Bloom’s Taxonomy.

1. Features
